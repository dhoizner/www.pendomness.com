![Pen World, Ahoy!](/images/pen-world-ahoy/happy-new-year.jpg)

Hello, lovely pen (and non-pen) folk! It's a brand new year (well, it was about a month ago), and after much prompting, I have made the leap into starting up a brand new site. There isn't much here yet, but I hope to flesh it out soon!

Much <s>blame</s> thanks goes to [Thomas R. Hall](http://penucopia.com) for the starting push, and to [Tony Giunta](http://mentalcloister.com) for helping with the name.

See you soon!
